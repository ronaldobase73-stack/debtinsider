      <p>Sometimes, fortune doesn’t knock—it crashes through the front door. That’s exactly what happened when an unsuspecting man stumbled upon a digital goldmine worth <strong>$100,000 in Bitcoin</strong>, all because of a simple typing error.</p>

      <p>According to his account, he was attempting to log into an old crypto wallet he believed to be empty. Instead, by mistakenly entering a set of forgotten login details, he suddenly found himself staring at a six-figure balance blinking back at him. What began as an ordinary day turned into an electrifying moment of pure euphoria.</p>

      <p>“It felt unreal,” he shared. “I thought it was a glitch. Then I realized I had just unlocked a wallet I’d abandoned years ago. It was like opening a time capsule of wealth.”</p>

      <p>This accidental discovery highlights the incredible unpredictability of cryptocurrency. Lost wallets, forgotten passwords, and digital keys are the modern equivalent of buried treasure. And sometimes, luck favors the persistent—or the lucky mistypers.</p>

  <p>Every so often, fortune arrives in the most unexpected ways. For one man, a random mistake in typing login details turned into a life-changing moment when he unlocked a <strong>long-forgotten crypto wallet containing over $100,000 worth of Bitcoin</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>He had originally believed the wallet was empty and destined for digital oblivion. But after entering a set of credentials he barely remembered, he was stunned to see the balance load on his screen. “At first, I thought it was an error,” he admitted. “Then it hit me—this was real money I’d abandoned years ago.”</p>
